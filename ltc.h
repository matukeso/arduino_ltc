   @brief libltc - en+decode linear timecode

   Linear (or Longitudinal) Timecode (LTC) is an encoding of
   timecode data as a Manchester-Biphase encoded audio signal.
   The audio signal is commonly recorded on a VTR track or other
   storage media.

   libltc facilitates decoding and encoding of LTC from/to
   timecode, including SMPTE date support.
